# AI-Scribe

## Introduction

> This is a script that I worked on to help empower physicians to alleviate the burden of documentation by utilizing a medical scribe to create SOAP notes. Expensive solutions could potentially share personal health information with their cloud-based operations. It utilizes `Koboldcpp` and `Whisper` on a local server that is concurrently running the `Server.py` script. The `Client.py` script can then be used by physicians on their device to record patient-physician conversations after a signed consent is obtained and process the result into a SOAP note.
