# AI-Scribe
This is a script that I worked on to help empower physicians to alleviate the burden of documentation.  Expensive solutions could potentially share personal health information with their cloud-based operations.  It utilizes Koboldcpp and Whisper on a local server that is concurrently running the Server.py script.  The Client.py script can then be used by physicians on their personal device to record patient-physician conversations after a signed consent is obtained and process the result into a SOAP note.
